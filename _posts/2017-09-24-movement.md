I looked at a  
dance and saw  
beauty and grace of  
movement timed  
by music patterns  
hands clasped  
circles in tableau  
before me as I  
watched.  
  
I joined a dance  
and felt the thrum  
throughout my body  
rolled a drum  
I sweat, I ached  
and smiled to see  
my partner sweat  
and ache with me  
The pattern I  
could not discern  
amid the steps  
I had to learn  
we felt the music  
in our hands  
our circles held  
the song's commands  
And when it ended  
I was sure  
I'd dance again  
and watch no more
