Speak friend and enter, but beware:  
This zoo is not logical. Nothing  
Is on display for your amusement.  
(for indeed, Nothing is very amusing)  
  
Here there be dragons to discover,  
Joy and other mythical creatures  
Truly dangerous. You might not survive.  
  
If you flounder in seas of symbols  
You may find the Salmon of All Knowledge.  
Watch out for red herrings.  
  
When you leave, take something with you,  
Spiky and uncomfortable. Take, take, fill  
Your hands, your head, your hollow chest;  
Your belly laughs await their food.
