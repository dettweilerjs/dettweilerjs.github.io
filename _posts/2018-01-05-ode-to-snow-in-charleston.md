There is a certain 'Southern charm'  
That, while not gone, does come to harm  
In winter snows; an ill wind blows  
Which shivers though it should be warm.  

And nearly everybody knows  
In this fine city, how it goes:  
A place replete with summer heat  
Must, later on, remain unfroze.  

Thus, mumbling we all repeat  
As if our words would stop the sleet.  
"It isn't fair, this frosty air!"  
Foully we weather our defeat.  

Amid such loss, we must take care  
To give and give, to smile and share  
Ourselves. Thereby, never will die  
The 'charm' so famous everywhere.  

Good reputation does not lie  
In what emerges from the sky.  
Though it may storm, our actions form  
What we are known for, by and by.
