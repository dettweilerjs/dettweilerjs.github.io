**Television Snow Day** was written mainly in college. A snow day is when you get to stay home and rest; a television snow day is the same thing for the mind, quiet space in between the noise. Published 2016.

### Book 3 - Here Now!

**Joy and Other Mythical Creatures** came out of my attempts to seek out the bright places and details rather than the morbid ones. Whether it succeeds at finding them is a different matter - mythical creatures are hard to pin down. Published 2020.
